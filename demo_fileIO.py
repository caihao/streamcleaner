#How to use this file:
#step one: using https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Mambaforge-Windows-x86_64.exe
#install python.
#step three: locate the dedicated python terminal in your start menu, called mambaforge prompt.
#within that prompt, give the following instructions:
#conda install pip numpy scipy
#pip install librosa tk dearpygui np-rw-buffer numba
#if all of these steps successfully complete, you're ready to go, otherwise fix things.
#run it with python demo_fileIO.py
